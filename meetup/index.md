The Elixir Calgary Meetup is held on the 3rd Wednesday of every other Month. Everyone is welcome to join, whether you're a seasoned Elixir pro or just curious to learn more about Functional Programming!

There will normally be food and drink provided from one of the Meetup's sponsors, as well as technical talks presented by members of the local Elixir community. You can find more info about the meetup, as well as a schedule of upcoming events at [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/elixir-calgary/).
